% In the realm of Emotia, people experience two kinds of emotional connections:
% romance and friendship. We will explore the relationships between these
% emotional states using category theory, functors, and natural
% transformations.
%
% First, let's define the inhabitants of Emotia: Alice, Bob, and Carol.

Inductive person := Alice | Bob | Carol.

(*
% Now we will define the relationships between the inhabitants of Emotia.
% Alice has a romantic relationship with Bob, Bob has a romantic relationship
% with Carol, and Carol has a romantic relationship with Alice.
*)

Inductive relationship : person -> person -> Type :=
  | rel_Alice_Bob : relationship Alice Bob
  | rel_Bob_Carol : relationship Bob Carol
  | rel_Carol_Alice : relationship Carol Alice.

(*
% We represent the intensity of romantic feelings with love-based emotional
% states (L) and the intensity of friendships with friendship-based emotional
% states (F).
*)

Definition L (p : person) := nat.
Definition F (p : person) := nat.

(*
% We define two functors, L_functor and F_functor, which represent how romantic
% relationships and friendships affect emotional states.
*)

Definition L_functor (r : relationship Alice Bob) : L Alice -> L Bob :=
  fun l_a => l_a.
Definition F_functor (r : relationship Alice Bob) : F Alice -> F Bob :=
  fun f_a => f_a.

(*
% As people in Emotia interact with each other, their emotional states change.
% We will capture this using a natural transformation α, which represents the
% uniform way that romantic feelings can turn into friendships.
*)

Definition alpha (p : person) (l_p : L p) : F p := l_p.

(*
% Now, we want to demonstrate that α is indeed a natural transformation. To do
% so, we need to show that α satisfies the naturality condition.
*)

Lemma naturality_condition : forall (r : relationship Alice Bob) (l_a : L Alice),
    F_functor r (alpha Alice l_a) = alpha Bob (L_functor r l_a).
Proof.
  intros r l_a.
  unfold F_functor, L_functor, alpha.
  destruct r.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(*
% Our proof of the naturality condition shows that the transformation α from
% romantic feelings to friendships is indeed natural. In the story of Emotia,
% this means that the way in which romantic feelings turn into friendships is
% consistent across all inhabitants and relationships.
%
% Through this exploration, we have discovered the underlying structure and
% consistency in the realm of Emotia, where romance and friendship intertwine.
