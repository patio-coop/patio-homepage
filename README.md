Patio Interational Worker Co-operative Association Homepage
===========================================================

### Contents

`prototype/` contains a straight HTML/CSS/etc. version of the prototype
page. The static site generation system (to be added later) should produce
essentially the same output under the `output/` directory.

At <https://patio-coop.github.io/patio-homepage/prototype/> (on GitHub
Pages) we publish one branch of the repo. This is whatever branch a
developer happened to need to show to others at the time; feel free to
change it when you need it. (It's set by clicking on the _Settings_ tab and
then in _Pages_ in left sidebar.)

### Developers

For development help contact `@cjs_tng_jp` or `@yasu_tng_jp` on Patio
Mattermost chat, or anybody else in the `#homepage-technical` channel.
Design and content is done by the folks in the `#Community Landing Page`
group.
